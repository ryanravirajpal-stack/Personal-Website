        <p>
          Hello, I am a political psychologist studying American politics, polarization, and communication. 
          My previous work investigates associations between political social media, behavior, and
          affective polarization. My current work has been short-term investigations of public opinion at the PPL Institute, a prototype
          of an educational nonprofit that I'm still building out. If you are interested in my academic background, feel free to <a class="modal-button" href="Ryan Rajpal - Curriculum Vitae.pdf" download>

          In addition to research, I also bartend professionally from an appreciation for mixology. Drawn to sour, punchy drinks,
          my personal favorite is a midori sour. For my full drink menu, please visit the <a href="Bar.html">bartending</a> page.
