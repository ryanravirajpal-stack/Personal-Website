        <p>
          Hello— I am a political psychologist specializing in American politics and experimental methods. 
          My previous work investigates associations between online political communication and
          affective polarization. My current work is largely observational, though I maintain technical sharpness
          through the PPL Institute. I will be applying to graduate school programs in political science and 
          government in fall 2026. To see my academic background, please <a class="modal-button" href="Ryan Rajpal - Curriculum Vitae.pdf" download>

          In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also an experienced bartender like to experiment with flavors, 
          preferring sour cocktails with an acidic kick, like midori sours. For my full drink menu of cocktails
          and originals, please visiting the <a href="Bar.html">Bartending</a> page.s University, where he graduated summa cum laude and with the highest honors in political science.
